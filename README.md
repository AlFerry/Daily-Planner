# Daily-Planner
A daily planner to keep track of my busy schedule

User story:
As a working individual, I want to keep track of my day by filling in
an interactive calendar that saves my entries if I leave the page and
shows if events have occured in the past or will occur in the future.

-This program uses javascript to create timeblocks for every hour in a typical workday.
-The current day is displayed at the top of the screen.
-Each timeblock shows the hour, a textbox, and a save button.
-When a user types tasks or meetings into the textbox and clicks the save button, the input
 is saved to local storage and will still be displayed if the page is re-loaded.
-The textboxes are styled using colors to signal timeblocks from past hours, the current hour,
 and future hours.
